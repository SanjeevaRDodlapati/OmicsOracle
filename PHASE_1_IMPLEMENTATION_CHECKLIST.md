## ï¿½ **STARTING NOW - Phase 1.2: Core Architecture Design**

### **Critical Dependencies Installation** (Day 1)
```bash
# Step 1: Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Step 2: Install GEO-specific dependencies
pip install entrezpy>=2.1.3
pip install GEOparse>=2.0.3  
pip install pysradb>=1.4.2
pip install geofetch>=0.12.6

# Step 3: Install NLP dependencies
pip install spacy>=3.7.0
pip install scispacy>=0.5.3
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.3/en_core_sci_sm-0.5.3.tar.gz

# Step 4: Install development tools
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Step 5: Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### **Quality Tools Setup** (Day 1-2)
- [ ] Configure black code formatting
- [ ] Set up mypy type checking
- [ ] Configure flake8 linting
- [ ] Install bandit security scanning
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create pre-commit hooks configuration

### **Project Structure Completion** (Day 2-3)
- [ ] Create all missing core modules
- [ ] Set up test structure with fixtures
- [ ] Create configuration management system
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create development documentation

## ðŸ“‹ **IMMEDIATE NEXT TASKS - Week 1**

### **Day 1: Environment & Dependencies**
1. Install all GEO-specific libraries
2. Test basic connectivity to NCBI APIs
3. Verify spaCy and SciSpaCy installation
4. Set up quality tools (black, mypy, flake8)

### **Day 2: Core Structure**
1. Create all missing module files
2. Set up basic configuration system
3. Create logging infrastructure
4. Set up development database (SQLite)

### **Day 3: Basic Integration**
1. Test entrezpy NCBI connection
2. Test GEOparse with sample data
3. Create basic CLI interface
4. Set up unit test framework

## âš¡ **READY TO IMPLEMENT**

The development plan is now **IMPLEMENTATION-READY** with:

âœ… **Complete requirements** with all GEO-specific dependencies
âœ… **Quality-first approach** integrated throughout
âœ… **Clear phase breakdown** with specific deliverables  
âœ… **Comprehensive testing strategy** built-in
âœ… **Scientific validation framework** established
âœ… **CI/CD pipeline** ready for setup
âœ… **Multi-repository deployment** configured

## ðŸŽ¯ **SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR PHASE 1**

By end of Week 2, we should have:
- All GEO tools installed and tested
- Basic NLP pipeline functional
- CLI interface for testing queries
- Quality tools enforcing code standards
- CI/CD pipeline running automated tests
- First successful query: "WGBS brain cancer human"

## ðŸš€ **RECOMMENDATION: START IMMEDIATELY**

The project is ready for Phase 1 implementation. All critical components are identified, documented, and ready for development.
